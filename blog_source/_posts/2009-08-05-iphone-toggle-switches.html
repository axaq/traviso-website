<p>
  Way back in June, <a href="http://awardwinningfjords.com/">Thomas Reynolds</a>
  released <a
  href="http://awardwinningfjords.com/2009/06/16/iphone-style-checkboxes.html">iPhone-style-checkboxes
  for jQuery</a>, a progressive enhancement for checkboxes which makes them into
  the beautiful iPhone toggle switches. I really like these switches on the
  iPhone so I went about finishing up his version for the Prototype framework.
  Of course, I couldn't help but add some new features along the way!
</p>

  <strong>
    You definitely need to <a href="http://thejqr.com{{ page.url }}">read
    this article on my site</a> to see all the cool JavaScript effects I'm
    talking about!
  </strong>
</p>

<h3>Variable sizes</h3>

<p>
  The initial version supported changing the ON/OFF label text, but if you made
the text longer than a few characters, it would be hidden under the handle. I
set about making the handle and label sizes automatic based on the actual
label text, giving a really nice
<a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/new-iphone/index.html">iphone 4</a> look to the
handle and label.
</p>

<p>
  <div><label class="left" for="variable_size_male_female">Sex</label> <input type="checkbox" id="variable_size_male_female"/></div>
  <div><label class="left" for="variable_size_a_b">Path</label> <input type="checkbox" id="variable_size_a_b"/></div>
</p>

<p>
  As a bonus, you can also specify that no automatic resizing should be done and
  do the control and handle sizing with CSS to make a group of controls uniform.
</p>

<div style="width: 400px;">
  <div><label class="left" for="static_size_a">Be you robot?</label> <input type="checkbox" id="static_size_a"/></div>
  <div><label class="left" for="static_size_b">Comments</label> <input type="checkbox" id="static_size_b"/></div>
  <div><label class="left" for="static_size_c">Option C</label> <input type="checkbox" id="static_size_c"/></div>
</div>

<h3>Draggable</h3>

<p>
  They certainly looked like the iPhone switches, but they didn't feel like
  them. You could only click them to toggle, we needed to add support for
  dragging the control.
</p>

<div><label class="left" for="variable_size_male_female">Do it</label> <input type="checkbox" id="draggable" checked="checked"/></div>

<h3>Sliding labels</h3>

<p>
  A quick check through the network graph revealed <a
  href="http://github.com/mlangenberg">Matthijs Langenberg</a> had devised a
  clever way to slide the labels along with the handle. This was the final
  piece, now the our JavaScript was nearly indistinguishable from the native
  iPhone one.
</p>

<p>
  <div><label class="left" for="sliding_labels">Go man go!</label> <input type="checkbox" id="sliding_labels" /></div>
</p>

<h3>iPhone compatibility</h3>

<p>
  Last but not least, our checkboxes didn't support dragging on the iPhone!
  Since the iPhone sends out touch events instead of mouse ones, all of our
  cool dragging code would need to be updated. As of today, both
  versions of this plugin now fully support the iPhone.
</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>
  A huge thanks to Thomas Reynolds for his development on this awesome plugin
  and giving me the ability to add these improvements.
