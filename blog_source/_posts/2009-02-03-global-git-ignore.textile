title: Basic Iso World
summary: Creating a simple isometric world.
---
Creating an isometric world with Traviso is pretty straightforward. Here is what u need:

<ul>
  <li>Visuals for tiles and objects.</li>
  <li>An XML file for Traviso to know what goes where.</li>
</ul>

Note: Traviso is built on top of the pixi.js rendering engine. So if you haven't already check it out here.

<h3>Creating a tile image</h3>

Isometric tiles are defined by two parameters throughout Traviso:

<ul>
  <li><b>Iso-Angle:</b> The height of a single tile.
  	<img src="/images/posts/shift_control_option_r.jpg">
  </li>
  <li><b>Iso-Height:</b> The angle between the isometric edge and the isometric (horizontal) diagnal of the tile.
  	<img src="/images/posts/shift_control_option_r.jpg">
  </li>
</ul>

Default value for the Iso-Angle is 30 degrees and default height is .....





Git supports global ignores just like any good SCM.

{% highlight sh %}
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
$ printf ".DS_Store\nThumbs.db\n" >> ~/.gitignore
{% endhighlight %}


For good measure I threw in Windows' creepy file <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbs.db">Thumbs.db</a>.

Sadly this won't stop other developers from accidentally committing those files, so you still need to add those ignores to your .gitignore in every project. I've setup my <a href="http://github.com/jqr/dotfiles/raw/master/bash_profile.d/git.sh">git init alias</a> to do this for me.
