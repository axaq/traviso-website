            An 'object' tag should include the following attributes:
               id:             (Numbers except 0) This is the key value that you will use to define the type of the object. These will be used in the 
                               object_map below. DON'T use 0 as id since it represents no-objects in the object_map.
               movable:        (0/1) This defines weather other characters can move onto a tile that this objects sits on.
               interactive:    (0/1) This specifies weather the user can select/interact with the object. The engine will use the callbacks to inform 
                               the developer once the object is selected by the user.
               s:              This specifies the size of the object in the number of rows and colums (rows x colums).
               noTransparency: (0/1) This specifies if the engine will make the object transperent or not when the main controller is behind it.
               floor:          (0/1) This specifies if the object is a floor-object (like a rug) or not.
            
            An 'object' tag should also include AT LEAST one v tag with id 'idle'.
            
            NOTE: You can define as many visuals (single images or animation sequences) as you want using v tags.

                You can create your textures/animations in two ways.
                1. Either in a single v tag by providing filename/path prefix and extension.
                2. Or using child f tags to specify each frame texture if your image names are not in a numeric order like walk1.png, walk2.png ...
                  id:                 Id of the texture or animation. You will use this to change object texture/animation any time.
                  path:               Image name/id as it is accessed throughout a cached spritesheet or with a path externally.
                  ext:                Image file extension. i.e. png, jpg
                  number_of_frames:   Number of frames in an animation. if it is not an animation but a single texture, set it to 1.
                  start_number:       Starting number of the image name suffix. This is only used for animations where image names are in a numeric order like walk3.png, walk4.png ...
                  ipoc:               Interaction-point column-offset for the visual.
                  ipor:               Interaction-point row-offset for the visual.
                
                If you want to create an interaction point for a visual you can set interaction-point-offset by defining 'ipor' and 'ipoc' as row and column. This 
                means when the you use methods like 'moveControllableToObj' the engine will move the controllable to this interaction points instead of just the nearest 
                neighbouring tile. For instance, you can have characters interacting and you can allow your controllable character to interact with other characters 
                depending on which way they are looking. 
                
                !!! NOTE 1:   Following ids are reserved, so for additional animations use different ids:
                              idle_s, idle_sw, idle_w, idle_nw, idle_n, idle_ne, idle_e, idle_se, move_s, move_sw, move_w, move_nw, move_n, move_ne, move_e, move_se
                !!! NOTE 2:   'f' tags of a 'v' tag has priority over attributes defining animation sequences. So if you use both the engine will process only the 'f' tags.
                !!! NOTE 3:   For an object, at minimum, one 'v' tag with the id "idle" is required. This will also be used as the initial visual (single texture or animation sequence)
                              that will be applied to your object until you change it in your own logic.

        1) When used with 'single_ground_image' tag, you don't necesserily need 'tiles' tag. You can 
           only include 0s and 1s to define which of the areas on the map are walkable. But you can also 
           still put individual tile images on top of your global ground image by defining them in 'tiles' tag.
        2) If there is no 'single_ground_image' defined then that means each tile has its own image
           which should be defined under 'tiles' tag.
